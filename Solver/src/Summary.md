# Boggle-like Word Puzzle Solver Project

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

You're building a **solver for a Boggle-like word puzzle** on an **8x6 board** where:
- Words must be formed by moving to adjacent letters (8 directions).
- Each letter can be used only once.
- The goal is to find a set of valid dictionary words that **cover every letter on the board exactly once**, with **no overlapping letters or crossing paths**.

## âœ… What You've Built So Far

### 1. **Trie Data Structure**
- Implemented a `Trie` class to store dictionary words.
- Loaded words from `sowpods.txt`, filtering for words with 4+ letters.

### 2. **Board Representation**
- Created a method to convert a 48-character string into an `8x6 char[,]` board.
- Added a helper to print or visualize the board.

### 3. **WordPath Class**
- Represents a word and its path on the board:
    - `string Word`
    - `List<(int Row, int Col)> Positions`
    - `List<((int, int), (int, int))> Edges` (for path crossing detection)

### 4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Implemented `DepthFirstSearch` to find all valid words on the board.
- Returns a list of `WordPath` objects.
- Uses the Trie to prune invalid paths early.

### 5. **Edge Crossing Detection**
- Implemented a method to detect if two edges cross diagonally (e.g., forming an X in a 2x2 square).
- Used to enforce the "no crossing paths" rule.

### 6. **Recursive Solver**
- Backtracking algorithm that:
    - Tries combinations of `WordPath`s.
    - Ensures no reused letters or crossing paths.
    - Stops when all 48 positions are covered.

### 7. **Preloading Known Words**
- Added ability to:
    - Input known words.
    - Select from multiple matching `WordPath`s.
    - Preload them into the solver to constrain the solution space.

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps (When You Return)

Here are some ideas for where to pick up:

1. **Integrate the graphical output** into your main program flow.
2. **Add UI or CLI interactivity** for selecting known words and paths.
3. **Optimize performance** (e.g., parallel search, smarter pruning).
4. **Export/import solutions** for reuse or sharing.
5. **Add logging or metrics** to track solver performance.
